# This is an exercise on "Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries"

# Lists
# Setting up an empty or dummy list
data = []
names = list()

# Lists with data
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(numbers)
dnames = ["Srinivas", "Baskar", "Sangameswari", "Shyamala", "Sowmya", "Praveena"]
print(dnames)
# Nested Lists
data1 = [numbers, dnames]
print(data1)

# list functions
print(names + dnames)
