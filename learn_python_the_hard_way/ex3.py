# Exercise - 3 : Numbers and Math
# Order of operation of these operators is "PEMDAS:Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition & substraction"

# performing a simple counting operation
print "I will now count my chickens"
print "Hens", 25 +30 / 6
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print "Now I will count the Eggs:"
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 -1 / 4 + 6

print "Is it true that 3 +2 < 5 -7?"
# evaluate a less than operation
print 3 + 2 < 5 -7

# performs a basic addition
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2

# performs a basic substraction
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7

print "Oh, that's why it says False"

print "How about some more."

# evalues greater than operation
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
# evalues greater or equals to operation
print "Is it greater or equals", 5 >= -2

# evalues less or equals to operation
print "Is it less or equals", 5 <= -2
